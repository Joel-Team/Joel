# Joel
Joel the Birb is available right here on your screen/in your pocket to inspire, comfort, and of course, dig for worms. Our goal for this project is simple- to bring a smile to your face! This project began as a simple doodle of a small birb, which eventually grew into the birb you see here today.

## View
You can view Joel online on his [Website](https://joel-online.web.app). You can also [download the android app](https://joel-online.web.app/apk/latest) or see him on Newgrounds.

## Installing source code
If you want Joel's full source code, go to the `web` branch and download the zip. You just have to open `index.html` in a browser and you will have the app ready for you.

If you just want Joel's assets, download the `art` branch.

If you're looking for the Android app, you can find its full source code in the `android` branch. You can build it with Apache Cordova.
